  ## Description
  
  This project takes inputs from the terminal and will display them in a README template in the generateMarkdown file. Then a markdown file called READMEsample will have the completed file.

  ## Installation
  
  From my github and is for public use
  
  ## Testing
  
  To test this project you simply have to open the terminal and install npm, inquirer.

  ## Contributing:
  
  This is mostly a solo project but if working with others on live server be wary of merge conflicts and be sure that all participants have npm and to gitignore the node_modules to prevent too much memory from being used when pulling.
