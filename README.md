# READMEmaker

The point of this assignment is to utilize nodejs to run a script that is capable of creating readme markdowns.

By using npm inquire to have the user be asked questions about what they would like to put into their file.
And then from there they will be able to navigate from different parts of the readme when they click on links on the page.
There will also be a link to my github portfolio at the bottom of the page.
