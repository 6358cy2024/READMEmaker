# READMEmaker

The point of this assignment is to utilize nodejs to run a script that is capable of creating readme markdowns.

By using npm inquire to have the user be asked questions about what they would like to put into their file.

Then the rest of the project is done in javascript to create the functions that ask the questions in the terminal and write the answers into a template for the README.

Once all of the questions have been answered, you will get a confirmation message in the terminal saying that your readme is completed

That file for this project is called READMEsample.md.

And then from there they will be able to navigate from different parts of the readme when they click on links on the page.

There will also be a link to the users github portfolio at the bottom of the page as well as their email so anyone who sees the project can contact them.
